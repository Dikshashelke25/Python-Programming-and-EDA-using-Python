    "- It is measurable and can have decimal points.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Height of individuals (e.g., 170.5 cm, 165.2 cm)\n",
    "  - Temperature readings (e.g., 36.5°C, 22.8°C)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Categorical Data**\n",
    "- Categorical data represents characteristics or labels that describe a group.\n",
    "- It is **not** numerical and cannot be measured.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Gender (Male, Female, Other)\n",
